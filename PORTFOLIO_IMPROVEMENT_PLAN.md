## 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY (Complete Within 1 Week)

### 4. Enhance Project Descriptions
For EACH project, add:
- [ ] **Specific technologies used** (be detailed: "React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)")
- [ ] **Your role** in collaborative projects (what YOU specifically built)
- [ ] **Problem solved** (What user problem does this solve?)
- [ ] **Metrics** if possible:
  - "Reduced load time by 40%"
  - "Supports 100+ concurrent users"
  - "Mobile-responsive across 5+ devices"

Example improvement:
```javascript
// BEFORE (vague):
desc: 'React Todo app with hooks, clean UI, and full CRUD functionality.'

// AFTER (specific & impressive):
desc: 'Feature-rich todo application with real-time state management using React Hooks (useState, useReducer, useContext). Implements localStorage persistence, drag-and-drop reordering, and category filtering. Optimized for mobile with touch gestures and offline functionality.'
```

### 5. Add More Substantial Projects
